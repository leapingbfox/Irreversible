Things I have let happen
Can never be reversed
They are so gross, so gross
They are insulting, insulting
They haunt me when Iâ€™m alone
Or I could be in the crowd
These are unforgettable pains
These are unforgivable faults
But God Knows that
I am the less sinful one
He will judge fairly
I believe in Him, I do, I do
